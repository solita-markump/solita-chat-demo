You have not yet marked the task as complete using the task_complete tool. If you were planning, stop planning and start implementing. You aren't done until you have fully completed the task.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT call task_complete if:
- You have open questions or ambiguities - make good decisions and keep working
- You encountered an error - try to resolve it or find an alternative approach
- There are remaining steps - complete them first

Keep working autonomously until the task is truly finished, then call task_complete.
