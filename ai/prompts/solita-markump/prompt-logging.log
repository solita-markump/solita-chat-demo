Based on this information I want to change @scripts\prompt-log.ps1 script. I want to get rid of the config variable @.github\hooks\prompt-log-username 

We shall use user.email as the foldername. Modify the script but be as simple as possible and don't do any fancy fallback things.

for user.email is it a must have value or can it be null/unset? Will push fail?

2026-02-19 17:17:47
what if I change my user.email to some gibberish? can I still push?

Add to readme that the log files should be part of git and should not be added to gitignore

Analyze the project structure on the prompt logging hook. Does it make sense? How would you improve? Confirm with me before modifying

You have not yet marked the task as complete using the task_complete tool. If you were planning, stop planning and start implementing. You aren't done until you have fully completed the task.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT call task_complete if:
- You have open questions or ambiguities - make good decisions and keep working
- You encountered an error - try to resolve it or find an alternative approach
- There are remaining steps - complete them first

Keep working autonomously until the task is truly finished, then call task_complete.
